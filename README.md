Restaurant Review Sentiment Analysis

This project aims to analyze customer reviews for restaurants and determine the sentiment behind them (positive, negative, or neutral). By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models, this analysis helps restaurants understand customer feedback and improve their services.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess textual data, including tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming/lemmatization.
Sentiment Classification: Use classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify review sentiments.
Visualization: Generate visualizations such as word clouds and sentiment distribution charts to provide insights into customer opinions.
Evaluation Metrics: Measure model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Optionally deploy the sentiment analysis model as a web app using Flask or Streamlit for real-time sentiment analysis on new reviews.
Tech Stack:
Python (Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM)
NLP (Tokenization, Stop-word Removal, Stemming)
Optional: Flask/Streamlit for deployment
